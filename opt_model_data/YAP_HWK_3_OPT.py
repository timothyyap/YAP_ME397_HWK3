#hi!
#change 2?

#third change
# i don't really know what to do, but I've done the git commits
#

#What change? Unbelievable. I can't even read myself
#this is copied (at first ok) straight from the given code
#also, frankly, I'm using the VSCode's LOVELY GUI, with a nice (check) commit button
#and then clicking through it all
#bring me back to MATLAB pls

What is the least cost optimal mix of wind, solar, and energy storage system (ESS) to deliver a constant amount of power demand?
